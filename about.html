                <p>I'm Nathan, a software engineer in Edmonton, Canada. I've always had
                    an eye towards building things that simplify lives, and software is no
                    exception.
                </p>

                    <!-- Recently, I've taken the deep dive into self-hosting, building up a small infrastructure of servers on
                    my internal network. This has lead me to learn about all different aspects of software and hardware,
                    combining my knowledge as a software dev and sysadmin. Through this I have
                    learned so much, setting up networks with VPNs, virtual LANs, and firewalls; deploying and modifying
                    open source software to serve my network; building programs to automate my workflows; and building
                    software to host on my own network. I now host some of my own applications, most notably my Discord
                    bot
                    <a href="https://top.gg/bot/773117222380896276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve</a>,
                    deployed to many Discord
                    guilds and serving hundreds of people daily. -->

                <p>
                    When not programming however, I enjoy a multitude of other hobbies. One of them is photography and
                    videography. I love capturing the sights and moments of our beautiful world, particularly through
                    urban and landscape photography. I have been lucky enough to travel to many places to document these
                    locations, from right here at home to halfway across the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another hobby that developed through my love of computers and computer hardware came the homelab.
                    Deep in my basement is a collection of old enterprise servers, given a second life to host my little
                    piece of the internet. From here, I practice self hosting, server administration and networking.
                    This has allowed me to combine my knowledge as a software developer and systems administrator.
                    Deploying and hosting software, building workflow automation programs, and setting up network
                    services like VPNs, VLANs, and firewalls.

                    I started taking an interest in cars too, particular in Japanese Domestic Market cars. I currently
                    daily drive a 2001 Toyota Altezza, a sport sedan I imported directly from Japan. This car had me
                    learn how to maintain, diagnose, and fix all sorts of systems within a vehicle. It is extremely
                    enjoyable to drive, with just enough power and handling to be fun yet safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another is cycling. What better means is there to maintain fitness while exploring and seeing the
                    world? My road bike gives me the opportunity to discover undisturbed paths, uncover nature's beauty,
                    and challenge difficult terrains.
